I receive a message on LinkedIn from a recruiter, starts telling me about this job he's representing. Company called M&C Saatchi looking for a Data Scientist. Bells start ringing in my head: that's where my ex-CEO had his start. So I send my candidacy, and a few weeks later I present to an office at the heart of Soho.

In the immortal words of Jay-Z: 'History don't repeat itself, it rhymes' (or was it <a href='https://quoteinvestigator.com/2014/01/12/history-rhymes/'>Theodor Reik</a>?), and so did mine. As quickly as my foot was in the door, my responsibilities morphed to being more managerial: more stakeholder management, more project management, more team management. Except there was a lot more focus on process, as it is the case with more mature organisations. More focus on creating and maintaining SOPs, on standardisation, on automation, on providing more with less.

And just like with 59A, I planned internships, planned projects, delegated work, and guided good practices. It was around this time I learned yet another important lesson (one which I learned the hard way, then forgot, and re-learned at a later point): people don't generally want or don't have time to see maps and charts, they want you to tell them either <i>exactly</i> what they should see and what they should say.

Oh, the photo? I am not a social person, but I do like running games of social deduction. More specifically, I regularly run games of Blood on the Clocktower, and offered to run one for charity for work. One of my colleagues kindly offered to paint my face to help with setting the atmosphere and ambiance. It was a very successful event, and we raised some money for charity!
