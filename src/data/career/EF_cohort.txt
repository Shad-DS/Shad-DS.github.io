After approximately 5 months of job hunting in London (maybe I just didn't interview well back then?), I received 3 emails from EF. To be honest, I ignored the first email. I thought it was spam! I also ignored the second email (I know, right?); thought it was too good to be true. But after the third email, I thought 'What's the worst that can happen? I get rejected?' And that was the right call. I met amazing people, some of which went to found their start-ups, others who didn't but are doing amazing work elsewhere.

Being a cohort member at EF tought me about how to maximise the time you have with your potential co-founder, how to think about the advantages of your skillset, the mentality and the world of start-ups, how ideation can take place, what it is like to work in a very intense environment.

The photo on the left is me with one of my colleagues from EF! Though I cannot remember whether we took this photo before or after our time at EF, I know he went on to do amazing work as a ML Engineer!
