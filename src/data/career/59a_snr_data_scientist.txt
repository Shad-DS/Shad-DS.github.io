With the changing ways of working, so to did my responsibilities change at 59A. I was now responsible for working to create sales pitches for the American branch, while also managing a team of around 5 junior Data Scientists and Software Developers. In addition, the company is also bigger, and I am involved in almost every part of it (barring sales and senior leadership, of course!). I do enjoy managing a team, but I also learned the hard way that managing a team is itself almost a full time job. So much so that, the more I was devoted to managing and better my team, the less I was developing from a technical standpoint.

This was the third big lesson in my career. Becoming more senior in a company presents only 2 paths: you either develop a very specialised skill (e.g. become very skills in a very specific programming language or cloud infrastructure) or you become more administrative and managerial. Maybe my experience is not wrong, but there isn't a way to blend both pathways, so when the business needed me to follow the latter, I did.

The photo on the left is an experiment that the CEO wanted to do: ambiciously, he wanted (and did, as far as I know) to create art out of data, as though we were putting them in an Exhibit. So I took a campaign we finished, and plotted the number of impressions delivered per postcode in England/Scotland/Wales, taking inspiration from Joy Division's <i>Unknown Pleasures</i> cover album.

This also marked the time for me to leave 59A. My team, now about 9 members strong, was in a good place to continue to innovate and take those small steps to define new Gold Standards in the industry.
