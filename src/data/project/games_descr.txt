This was a simple website I created for my wedding, to help people pick which games they could play!

I wanted to learn how to use <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flask</a> as backend technology, and how it interacts with databases and, ultimately, the frontend. I ended up using <a href="https://www.sqlalchemy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SQLAlchemy</a>, more specifically <a href="https://flask-sqlalchemy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flask-SQLAlchemy</a> to interact with the local database I was playing with (which contained information about games we had available), as well as <a href="https://wtforms.readthedocs.io/en/3.2.x/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WTForms</a> and <a href="https://flask-wtf.readthedocs.io/en/1.2.x/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flask-WTF</a> to generate and parse data from forms.

If I was to continue working on this, I'd either make it more general for the games we now have (make it as live as possible), or make it into a recommendation system for users (also, and this has not escaped me, better documentation...).
