After approximately 5 months of job hunting in London (maybe I just didn't 
interview well back then?), I received 3 emails from EF. To be honest, 
I ignored the first email. I thought it was spam! I also ignored the 
second email (I know, right?); thought it was too good to be true. But after 
the third email, I thought "What's the worst that can happen? I get rejected?".
And that was the right call. I met amazing people, some of which went to 
found their start-ups, others who didn't but are doing amazing work elsewhere.

Being a cohort member at EF tought me about how to maximise the time you have 
with your potential co-founder, how to think about the advantages of your skillset,
the mentality and the world of start-ups, how ideation can take place, what it is
like to work in a very intense environment.

The photo on the right is me with one of my colleagues from EF! Though I cannot
remember whether we took this photo before or after our time at EF, I know
he went on to work as a ML Engineer!



No, sadly, my start-up idea did not get funded. I remember receiving the news at the end of a very long day of volunteering at the London Pride Parade (virtue signalling much?). In the interim period, I remained in contact with another colleague from EF, who was planning to do a short, intense, Data Science conversion course. Luckily for him, though, his start-up <italic>was</italic> funded, so he had to drop out! I applied to fill the newly-vacated position and got the position!<br/><br/>S2DS (Science 2 Data Science) is a program designed to provide practical experience to academics, to help them in the job hunt. Pivigo (the company that organises S2DS) collaborates with companies on converting their business needs into short, 4-week projects, and assigns teams of 3 or more programmers to work on them. So, on my first week I learned that I was going to be working on a project for... Pivigo themselves!<br/><br/>My team was involved in developing a command line PoC for data analysis pipelines, using both Python and Bash (the outcome of which was fully productised into <a href="https://www.siisti.ai/">siisti.ai</a>). I was involved in market research and implementing NLP solutions. After the 5 weeks, I gave a 5min speech to round out our time there, which is what the photo on the left shows!
